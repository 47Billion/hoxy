# Hoxy\n\n**Description**: Web-debugging proxy API for node.\n\n**Documentation**: http://greim.github.io/hoxy/\n\n```javascript\nvar hoxy = require('hoxy');\n\nvar proxy = new hoxy.Proxy();\n\nproxy.intercept({\n  phase: 'response',\n  mimeType: 'text/html',\n  as: '$'\n}, function(req, resp){\n  resp.$('title').text('Unicorns.');\n});\n\nproxy.listen(8080);\n\n// now proxy your client through localhost:8080 \n```\n\n# Release notes:\n\n* **1.1.1** Added SSL support for requests (protocol: https).\n* **1.1.0** Added CLI functionality to scaffold new proxy projects.\n* **1.0.5** Fixed static conditional get fail, flexible contentType matching, ability to set fullUrl.\n* **1.0.4** npm distribution no longer contains test directory.\n* **1.0.3** Fixed issue #21 causing breakage on windows, due to use of unix domain sockets.\n* **1.0.2** Added `tee()` method to requests and responses, and accompanying tests.\n* **1.0.1** Fixed bug with URL pattern matching, added filtering tests.\n* **1.0.0** Initial release of Hoxy 1.0 rewrite.\n\n# Note: 1.x vs 0.x\n\nIf you're looking for the old command line version of hoxy, it's branched as `v0.2.x` in this repository and still available on npm.\nContinued updates to that branch are unlikely.\n\n1.x is an overhaul of the project.\n1.x is a programming API, whereas 0.x was a command line utility.\n1.x fully passes a decently large test suite.\n
