Overview
========

Hoxy is a web hacking proxy for node.js, intended for use by web developers.

How it Works
------------

Hoxy lets you to manipulate the HTTP conversation between your browser and the server. Normally, an HTTP proxy is transparentâ€”cookies, url-resolution and other origin-sensitive rules operate the same whether you're going through a proxy or not.

Hoxy capitalizes upon this fact. After the browser has sent the request to the proxy, but before the proxy has forwarded the request to the server, hoxy lets you manipulate the details of the request in arbitrary ways, such as adding or removing headers.

Likewise, after the server has returned the response to the proxy, but before the proxy has forwarded the response to the browser, hoxy lets you manipulate the details of the response in arbitrary ways, for example by running js-beautify against a response body containing minified JavaScript code.

This may come in useful in all sorts of scenarios, especially for complex production environments that are hard to debug and test against.
