# Hoxy 1.0

**Description**: A web debugging proxy API for node.

**Documentation**: http://greim.github.io/hoxy/

# Note: 1.x vs 0.x

If you're looking for the old command line version of hoxy, the latest and final version is tagged as 0.2.3 in this repository and still available via npm.

1.x is a ground-up rewrite and re-envisioning of the project.
0.x was a command line utility, whereas 1.x is a programming API.
This new version is still in an experimental state, but as of early 2014 is beginning to round the corner of usability.
